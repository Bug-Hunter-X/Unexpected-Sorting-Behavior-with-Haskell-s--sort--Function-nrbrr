This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Haskell related to the `sort` function from `Data.List`.  The `sort` function uses the default comparison function, which may not be suitable for all data types.  The `bug.hs` file shows examples where the default comparison works correctly and where it fails unexpectedly.  The `bugSolution.hs` demonstrates how to correct the issue by providing a custom comparison function.
